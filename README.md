## Overview of the Analysis
To review weather trends in the months of December and June within Oahu to determine if the potential surf and ice-cream shop is a sustainable year-round business.
## Results
3 major points of difference from the two analysis are:
- There is more data available to review in June than December (June:1,700) (December:1,517). This is strange where there are technically more days in December than June. This could suggest that there are less people on the island in December recording temperatures, that the recording stations are closed for the holidays etc. The population are however enough to perform statistical analysis on as  they are of similar enough size.
- Max temp in December is 83 where in June it is 85, min in December is 56 where in June it is 64. This shows that while the max temperatures are quite close, in December it can get much cooler showing a wider array of differences.
- The average temp in June is almost 75 where in December on average it is 71 with a standard deviation for December of 3.74 and in June of 3.25. This suggests that on average its cooler in December, however it is not drastically different between those two months.

## Summary
 Two additional queries that could be run to get more weather data for December and June are:

 - Running the same analysis but with reviewing the precipitation- this would help in determining if the trends in rainfall change month over month as that would impact having a surf shop if its hot and raining. 
 - Running the analysis for a smaller set of years, as there is data in this set from 2010 to 2017. With the trends in global temperatures overall rising it could be more useful to further group by years to see if there are any outlier years that are causing the averages to be higher or lower than they have seen in the recent 1-2 years
